Model should predict the accuracy of a DNN model.

Input:
    - hyperparameter vector Hi   
    - training and validation losss values and accuracy in the first E epochs
    - A positive integer M (m > e)

To predict
    - validation accuracy of DNN x after M epochs with Hi as hyperparameter vector.


Dataset
    - CifarNet trained on Cifar 10
       - CifarNet contains 2 convolutional layers
       - Hyperparameters: L and H at each conv layer
       - Total 4 hyperparameter per model iteration


    - HP_space.csv
        - sampled hyperparameter vector values
    
    - train_loss.csv
        - First 4 calues -> Hyperparaeter for those iterations
        - Following columns show the training losses
        - 150 epochs recorded. Each epoch has 50 mini batches
    
    - eval_loss.csv
        - Same as train_loss
        - Reports only 1 loss per epoch
    
    - eval_acc.csv
        - same as above
        - Reports 1 accuracy per epoch
    
    - dataPartition.txt
        - Use this as partitioning for training, testing and validating

    

Report the accuracies of the eval_acc of CifarNet predicted by the accModel on the test dataset in the following settings: (E=5, M=150), (E=10,M=150), (E=20, M=150), (E=30, M=150), (E=60, M=150)
